# Classroom Mob Programming Game

The _Classroom Mob Programming Game_ is designed to teach undergraduates about
Mob Programming. This in-class exercise uses techniques of role-playing games to
guide students toward fruitful collaboration.

The game assumes that students are already familiar with a programming language.
It is also assumed that at least some students are familiar with [Test-Driven
Development (TDD)](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html).
Although TDD is not strictly required, it provides an important red-green-refactor
rhythm that drives the work of the mob.

The following links provide everything else you need to run the game.

An instructor may choose to give students a template to get started. The following
templates may be useful.
